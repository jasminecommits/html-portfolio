<h1>Jasmine's Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>The opening robbing scene can be the best I've ever seen on a screen.</p>

<h3>Down with Love</h3>
<p>Reneé Zellweger and Sarah Paulson are a joy to watch in this very smart and cute movie.</p>

<h3>Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond</h3>
<p>I'm absolutely obsessed with this documentary about the making of Man on the Moon, a movie 
    in which Jim Carrey's method acting led to several crew members leaving the set with mental stress.</p>
